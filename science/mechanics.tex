Closed systems can actually exist if the collection of objects under investigation do not interact with anything outside of the system.

Consider the empty system $\emptyset$, an empty collection that contains no objects.
The empty system is a closed system that actually exists.

Implicit in establishing a closed system are the assumptions that all interactions with its objects are known and can be definitively measured.
An open system is a system that interacts with objects outside the system.

As a matter of logic, a system should be presumed closed and shown to be open.
However, the failure to establish a system to be open does not suffice to definitively conclude the system is closed.
