\subsection{Nature of classical physics}

\begin{answer}
	Closed systems can actually exist if the collection of objects under investigation do not interact with anything outside of the system.

	Consider the empty system $\emptyset$, an empty collection that contains no objects.
	The empty system is a closed system that actually exists.

	Implicit in establishing a closed system are the assumptions that all interactions with its objects are known and can be definitively measured.
	An open system is a system that interacts with objects outside the system.

	As a matter of logic, a system should be presumed closed and shown to be open.
	However, the failure to establish a system to be open does not suffice to definitively conclude the system is closed.

% functions of states 
\begin{answer}
	Consider a system consisting of six states $S = \left\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\right\}$.

	A law is given by a function $S \xrightarrow{f} S$ that assigns each state in $S$ to the state that results from evolution under the law.

	If any law is allowed, then the set of laws is given by the set of all functions from $S$ to $S$.

	If a law must satisfy the conservation of information, then the set of laws that are possible for a six-state system can be classified by the set of functions
	\begin{align}
		C & = \left\{ f : S \to S \mid \forall y \in S, \exists!\ x \in S. f(x) = y \right\},
	\end{align}
	where each function has the property that each element in its codomain has a corresponding, unique element in the domain that is mapped to it and thus each such function in $C$ is a bijection.
	The number of such laws, given by the size $\left|C\right| = 6!$ of $C$, is $6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720$.
	This is because any function $S \xrightarrow{f} S$ in $C$ can be defined by sampling from the space $S$ of outcomes six times without replacement.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}
	Consider the infinite system $\left\{\cdots, -1, 0, +1, +2, \cdots\right\}$.

	Examples of dynamical laws that are allowable include those given by the following equations.
	\begin{align}
		N(n+1) = N(n) - 1 \quad
		N(n+1) = N(n) + 2 \quad
		N(n+1) = -1^{N(n)} N(n)
	\end{align}
	On the other hand, the dynamical law given by the equation $N(n+1) = N(n)^2$ is not allowed because it does not satisfy the conservation of information.

\subsubsection{Spaces, Trigonometry, vectors}

\begin{answer}
	Consider the functions $f,g,\theta,t$ defined below.
	\begin{align}
		f(t)           & = t^4 + 3t^3 - 12t^2 + t - 6   \\
		g(x)           & = \sin x - \cos x              \\
		\theta(\alpha) & = e^\alpha + \alpha \ln \alpha \\
		t(x)           & = \sin^2x - \cos x
	\end{align}

	They are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:plot} above.

\begin{answer}
	The rule for vector subtraction is to add the augend add the result of reversing the direction of the addend.

	Any vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ satisfy the following equation.
	\begin{align}
		\vec{A} - \vec{B} & = \vec{A} + \left(-\vec{B}\right)
	\end{align}
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}
	For any vector $\vec{A}$, the magnitude $\left| \vec{A} \right| = \sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2}$ of $\vec{A}$ satisfies the following equations:
	\begin{align}
		\vec{A} \cdot \vec{A} & = A_x A_x + A_y A_y + A_z A_z & = \left| \vec{A} \right|^2.
	\end{align}
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}
	Let $\left(A_x = 2, A_y = -3, A_z = 1\right)$ and $\left(B_x=-4, B_y=-3, B_z=2\right)$.

	The magnitude $\left|\vec{A}\right| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2 + 1^2}$ of $\vec{A}$ is $\left|\vec{A}\right| = \sqrt{4+9+1} = \sqrt{14}$, and the magnitude $\left|\vec{B}\right| = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-3)^2 + 2^2}$ of $\vec{B}$ is $\left|\vec{B}\right| = \sqrt{29}$.
	The dot product $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = 2(-4) + (-3)(-3) + 1(2)$ of $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ is $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = 3$.
	Since the angle $\theta$ between the two vectors satisfies $\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = \left|\vec{A}\right| \left|\vec{B}\right| \cos \theta$, it is given by $\dsp \theta = \cos^{-1} \frac{3}{\sqrt{406}}$ and approximated by $1.421$ radians.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}
	Consider the vectors $(1,1,1)$, $(2,-1,3)$, $(3,1,0)$, and $(-3,0,2)$.
	The pair of orthogonal vectors is $\dots$.

\subsection{Motion}

\begin{answer}
	Consider the functions $f,g,\theta,t$ defined by $f(t) = t^4 + 3t^3 - 12t^2 + t - 6$, $g(x) = \sin x - \cos x$, $\theta(\alpha) = e^\alpha + \alpha \ln \alpha$, and $t(x) = \sin^2x - \cos x$.

	The derivatives are given below.
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{df}{dt}           & = 4t^3 + 9t^2 - 24t + 1                \\
		\frac{dg}{dx}           & = \cos x + \sin x                      \\
		\frac{d\theta}{d\alpha} & = e^\alpha + 1 + \ln \alpha            \\
		\frac{dt}{dx}           & = \left(2 \sin x\right)\cos x + \sin x
	\end{align*}
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}
	Consider the functions $f,g,\theta,t$ defined by $f(t) = t^4 + 3t^3 - 12t^2 + t - 6$, $g(x) = \sin x - \cos x$, $\theta(\alpha) = e^\alpha + \alpha \ln \alpha$, and $t(x) = \sin^2x - \cos x$.

	The second derivatives are given by $\dsp \frac{d^2f(t)}{dt^2} = 12t^2 + 18t - 24$, $\frac{d^2g(x)}{dx^2} = \cos x - \sin x$, $\frac{d^2\theta(\alpha)}{d\alpha^2} = e^\alpha + \frac{1}{\alpha}$, and $\frac{d^2t(x)}{dx^2} = -\left(2\sin x\right)\sin x + \left(2 \cos x\right)\cos x + \cos x$.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}
	Consider the functions $g,\theta,x$ defined by $g(t) = \sin t^2 - \cos t^2$, $\theta(\alpha) = e^{3 \alpha} + 3 \alpha \ln 3 \alpha$, and $x(t) = \sin^2 t^2 - \cos t^2$.

	The chain rule yields $\frac{dg}{dt} = 2t \cos t^2 + 2t \sin t^2\dots$.
\end{answer}
